Implement the following two probems using map-reduce in Hadoop.

1. Given a set of n files, compute the frequency of each word across all the files. Print the list of words and their frequencies.
2. Given a set of n files, compute the frequency of k-letter words across all the files. For example, number of 4 letter words (5 occurrences of 'ball' + 3 occurrences of 'plan' = 8 frequency of 4 letter words). Print the list of number of letters and the frequency of the words with that many number of letters.
