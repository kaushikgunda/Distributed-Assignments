# Distributed-Assignments
This repository contains the 5 distributed assignments and my working codes for each of them.

All codes work fine.

Fixes to be done:-
1.The code for 5th Assignment is not correct. 

2.Commenting each code.

3.Clearing the cluster in each code.

4.Adding a clear explanation of each code and how parallelism is achieved in each .
